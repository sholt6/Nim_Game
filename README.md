# Nim Game
Nim is an ancient game in which two players take turns removing stones from three piles. On their turn, a player must remove stones from exactly one pile; they may take as many stones as they wish, from one to all the remaining stones. The goal is to be the player who empties the final pile. This repository contains an Java implementation of this game, built for two human players, who must specify their names and the sizes of the piles.

This program was written to satisfy coursework conditions for the MSc module Java and Databases. The grade achieved was 93%, with extra credit given for the inclusion of a method to represent each of the three piles with a pile of asterisks.
